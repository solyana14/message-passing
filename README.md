This is a C# publish-subscribe demo where Publishers (DogPublishers, CatPublishers) send message to PubSubServer and PubSubServer will catalog these messages into a queue and go through the queue of the messages and send each message to the corresponding subscriber. PubSubServer also catalogs the subscribers that are subscribing to certain topics. Subscribers (AnimalLover, OldCatLady) listen to Certain topic they want read and print the messages they received and the topic they are from. AnimalLover wants messages from all animals so they subscribe to both DogPublishers and CatPublishers but the OldCatLady only wants messages about cats so she subscribes to CatPublishers only.
Publishers are sender application that tag each message with the name of the topic. Subscribers are receiver applications that choose which topic to receive message from. PubSubServer is the director of all message and define a uniform message structure.
